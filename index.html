                <h4>Ruminations</h4>
                <p>The chart on above and to the left shows how many times each race has spoken throughout the each book in the LOTR series. This has been categorised further with the chart on the right to correlate the data with how many times in total
                    that a particular race has spoken. We can discern from this data who the predominant characters are within the series by who speaks the most. For Example, the race of Men have more words spoken in The Two Towers because of the interactions
                    within chapters between predominantly human settlements, such as Helms Deep or the Country of Rohan. We can also tell that there must have been some speeches to rouse the defenders of Helms Deep by the King and from Aragorn to help
                    to motivate the defenders against such a large army of Uruks. The interactions between Hobbits is the largest number within the dataset, for both words and for number of times speaking. We can tell from the data at which point in the
                    story these characters must be as the chapters with Frodo, Sam and Gollum contain a lot of interaction about the struggle to carry the ring and the burden that Gollum knows Frodo must carry, whilst trying to subliminaly turn him against
                    Sam Merry and Pippin are also predominant characters within the series and have major roles to play within the 2nd and 3rd books. Merry staying with the Rohirrim and helping engage the siege of Gondor, whilst Pippin in service to Denethor
                    has a big part to pay stewarding and pleasing his new lord.</p>

                <h4>More Ruminations</h4>
                <p>The data here shows the representation of each race according to "Named" characters within the books. As such the Dwarves for this trilogy are vastly under-represented due to Gimli being the only Character to have a speaking part. This
                    is also true with the race of the Dead and the races of Orcs and Ents. Due to few characters speaking within that particular race. This means that the data will be a little unrepresentative of unnamed characters within the universe
                </p>
                <p>Although the data here only mentions characters who have speaking parts, we can safely assume that other characters such as the other ring wraiths or the dwarves who accompanied Gimli to The Council of Elrond do exist here as well, however
                    are not added into our data set. This shows a litle un-representative majority of Men, but as the race of Men has far more characters, this is why they appear to be the largest data set</p>
