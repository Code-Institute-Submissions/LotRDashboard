# LoTR Dashboard
### Milestone Project 2 Overview
This project is a data dashboard, the data here is based upon data from the films books and characters 
based in the Lord of the Rings universe created bj J.R.R Tolkien. It will show graphs, charts and other data presentation tools
to make absorption of data easier than just a Excel spreadsheet. The main point of this project is to display my knowledge and skills from
D3, Crossfilter and other tools used to create a data dashboard.


## UX
My wireframes for the project can be found here https://app.moqups.com/xMaya2FvZh/view
The UX for this website is based upon people wishing to view data from different sources and different types. This data is for a few people
1. Users interested in the Movies and their Monetary values
2. Users interested in the percentages of the different Races in the LOTR Universe (Named Characters)
3. Users invested in the books and want to know who spoke the most, and where they spoke these words.
4. Users interested in seeing a list of all characters and being able to access further information on them through external links
The final Mockup can be viewed here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dp2fN33rxcm4ra_FnGlPMWTupz7ALKlr

## Features
### To be implemented
1. Landing Page, Dashboard space creation, List page created
2. CSS styles for the dashboard
3. All charts, graphs etc created
4. Charts displayed using SCSS and the tools within D3/CrossFilter

## Technologies Used
I have used a few different technologies to help my code this dashboard these are the following:
1. jQuery - This has been used to help simplify traversing the DOM and displaying different parts of the data.
2. D3 - This will be used to help simplify creating the different bars and charts
3. CrossFilter - This will also be used for the above reason.
4. BootStrap - Used to help minimise the amount of coding necessary with building the structure of the HTML
